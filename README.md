# Crowdfunding_ETL

My code is different from my partner's Daniel Papp.


This mini project is divided into the following subsections:
Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Campaign DataFrame
Contacts DataFrame
Crowdfunding Database

For the database we have inspected the four CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBDLinks![Crowdfunging ERD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118771610/227409681-fcdc7ebd-a22c-4f8e-948f-e0a79e548e44.png)
